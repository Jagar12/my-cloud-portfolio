Sumary: Used the PartyRock platform (powered by Amazon Bedrock) to generate a daily task scheduler application via AI. Generated the app, created and modified existing and new widgets, synchronizing them to work together, and published the app. Widgets were added to incorporate a wake time, sleep time, task list, time to complete each task, a motivational quote and picture, a schedule assistant chat and finally a widget for the generated schedule. Once the needed input is given, the application will generate a motivational quote, a motivational picture and finally the generated schedule.
